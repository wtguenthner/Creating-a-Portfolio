#My Portfolio
In this project, we created a page that displays an About Me, Work and Contact Me section. The navigation bar at the top links to the corresponding section on the index page and the links in the Contact section display my GitHub and LinkedIn profiles. The work section of the pages links to our future projects.

The page adapts to the screen size of the users monitor. In doing so, it makes the information more accessible to the viewer depeding on the size.
